# Net Worth Tracker - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

A minimal, lightweight web application that allows users to track their net worth by connecting financial accounts and manually adding physical/digital assets. Think Personal Capital's net worth feature, but simpler and focused solely on wealth tracking.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication

- Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- Password reset functionality
- Session management

### 2. Account Connection

- Financial Accounts: Integration with Plaid to connect:

  - Bank accounts (checking, savings)
  - Investment accounts (Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.)
  - Credit cards (for liability tracking)
  - Loans (mortgage, auto, personal)

- Manual Assets:
  - Vehicles (with optional KBB API integration for valuation)
  - Precious metals (gold, silver) with manual value entry
  - Real estate (manual entry)
  - Digital assets (crypto, stablecoins) with manual entry
  - Other assets (collectibles, etc.)

### 3. Dashboard Views

#### Main Dashboard

- Total net worth display with change indicator
- Quick stats: Total Assets, Total Liabilities
- Line graph showing net worth over time
- List of connected accounts with current balances
- "Refresh Data" button for manual updates

#### Three View Modes

1. **Net Worth View** (default)

- Line graph showing net worth trend
- Date range filters: YTD, This Year, Last Year, This Month, Last Month, 90d, 30d, All Time

2. **Assets View**

- Line graph showing total assets trend
- Breakdown by category (Cash, Investments, Property, Digital Assets, etc.)

3. **Liabilities View**

- Line graph showing total liabilities trend
- Breakdown by type (Credit Cards, Mortgages, Loans)

### 4. Account Management

- Add/remove connected accounts
- Edit manual asset values
- Disconnect all data (with confirmation)
- Account categorization (automatic for Plaid, manual for others)

### 5. Data Export

- Export to CSV format
- Include all transactions and balance history
- Date range selection for exports

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

```typescript
// Tech Stack
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- TanStack Start (for SSR/routing)
- shadcn/ui components
- Recharts for graphs
- TanStack Query for data fetching
```

### Backend

```typescript
// API Layer
- Node.js with Hono framework
- TypeScript
- Plaid SDK for financial connections
- KBB API for vehicle valuations (future)
- Redis for caching account balances
```

### Database Schema (Supabase/PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Core tables
users (id, email, created_at)
accounts (id, user_id, plaid_account_id, name, type, subtype)
account_balances (id, account_id, balance, date, currency)
manual_assets (id, user_id, name, category, value, updated_at)
plaid_items (id, user_id, access_token, item_id, institution_name)
```

### Data Flow

1. User connects account via Plaid Link
2. Store access_token securely in database
3. Fetch account balances and store in account_balances table
4. Display aggregated data in dashboard
5. Manual refresh triggers new Plaid API calls
6. Cache recent balances in Redis (5-minute TTL)

## API Endpoints

```typescript
// Account Management
POST /api/accounts/connect // Initiate Plaid Link
POST /api/accounts/callback // Handle Plaid callback
DELETE /api/accounts/:id // Remove account
GET /api/accounts // List all accounts

// Manual Assets
POST /api/assets // Add manual asset
PUT /api/assets/:id // Update asset value
DELETE /api/assets/:id // Remove asset

// Data Retrieval
GET /api/net-worth // Get net worth data with filters
GET /api/refresh // Trigger manual data refresh
GET /api/export // Generate CSV export
```

## Security Considerations

- All Plaid access tokens encrypted at rest
- Read-only access to financial accounts
- Rate limiting on refresh endpoints
- HTTPS only
- Supabase RLS policies for data isolation

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP

- Supabase auth setup
- Plaid integration for basic accounts
- Simple dashboard with net worth graph
- Manual asset entry
- Basic date filtering

### Phase 2: Enhancements

- KBB integration for auto values
- Improved caching layer
- Export functionality
- Better error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Polish

- Cron job for automatic daily updates
- More sophisticated charts
- Performance optimizations
- Mobile responsive improvements

## Key User Flows

### First-Time User

### First-Time User

1. Sign up with email/password
2. Land on empty dashboard
3. Click "Connect Account" â†’ Plaid Link flow
4. See first account balance appear
5. Add manual assets if desired
6. View net worth graph

### Returning User

1. Log in
2. See dashboard with last known balances
3. Click "Refresh" for latest data
4. Check different date ranges
5. Export data if needed

## Success Metrics (for personal tracking)

- Page load time < 1s
- Data refresh < 3s
- Zero data inconsistencies
- Successful Plaid connection rate
- App stability (uptime)
